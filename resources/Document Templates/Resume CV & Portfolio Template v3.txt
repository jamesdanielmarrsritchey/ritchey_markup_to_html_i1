## Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms

### Badge

DEFINITION:
In education, a badge (also referred to as a digital badge) is a digital record of academic achievement, which denotes the completion of an educational program, course, or exercise by a student. Badges are designed to be shared, and may also support being embedded into other pages.

### Career Portfolio

DEFINITION:
A career portfolio is a portfolio constructed for showcasing one's professional abilities to employers.

### Certificate

DEFINITION:
In education, a certificate is a record of academic achievement, in the form of a document, which denotes the completion of an educational program, or course by a student.

### Certification

DEFINITION:
A certification is a record, typically in the form of a document, of being declared (certified) as competent in a particular act, or skillset. When an organization certifies someone, it means they are vouching for that person's abilities. Certifications are usually awarded upon the completion of a test, or hands-on evaluation. However, some organizations will also provide a complete non-formal educational program to prepare students first. Some professions require certification, meaning the professional must hold certain certifications, by law, to perform that work. The term certificate is sometimes used interchangeably with certification, but certificates do not expire, as they are record of academic accomplishemnt. A certification does expire, after a set amount of time, because issuers are generally not comfortable vouching one's abilities indefinitely. Instead, renewals are used.
